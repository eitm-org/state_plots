# inputPanel(
#   selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
#               choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
#   
#   sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
#               min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
# )

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(10),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = .4)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})
```

## Embedded Application

It's also possible to embed an entire Shiny application within an R Markdown document using the `shinyAppDir` function. This example embeds a Shiny application located in another directory:

```{r tabsets, echo=FALSE}
# shinyAppDir(
#   system.file("examples/06_tabsets", package = "shiny"),
#   options = list(
#     width = "100%", height = 550
#   )
# )
```

Note the use of the `height` parameter to determine how much vertical space the embedded application should occupy.

You can also use the `shinyApp` function to define an application inline rather then in an external directory.

In all of R code chunks above the `echo = FALSE` attribute is used. This is to prevent the R code within the chunk from rendering in the document alongside the Shiny components.
